            <h2>Microsoft<span>Principal Engineer - Aug 2015-present - Redmond, WA</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A founding member of a team created to provide new data gateway technology for PowerBI</li>
                <li>Contributing principal engineer maintaining the Analysis Services engine which underlies PowerBI</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                PowerBI is Microsoft's flagship businiess intelligence product.  I joined this team as a principal engineer
                in order to apply more technical recent experience to the architecture of the database backing the PowerBI product, Analysis Services.
                Working alongside other principal engineers I had the opportunity to dive into an extensive code base stretching back
                multiple decades in order to assist in architecting such features as precomputed aggregation and explicit in-memory caching.
            </p>
            <h2>Boundary.com<span>Architect / Team Lead - Boundary Labs - April 2014-present - Austin, TX</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Initially acquiried by Boundary to offer general purpose one second monitoring</li>
                <li>Moved Graphdat technology into the forefront of the Boundary product offering</li>
                <li>Managed product development team</li>
                <li>Restructured the team around a new technology base</li>
                <li>Vastly improved scalability of the product in response to customer demand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Boundary acquired Graphdat.com in order to more broadly expand its existing network flow monitoring
                service with more general purpose server metric monitoring while keeping one second resolution on both.
                After acquisition I worked closely with engineering to integrate <b>Graphdat realtime graphs</b> onto existing dashboards
                and also to add scalability for customer growth.  In terms of scalability we moved the existing explicit cluster
                worker mapping scheme to a <b>consistent hash</b> based scheme (Guava), Zookeeper presence, with a <b>finer grained tuple</b> to better balance load.
                Internal to the data storage worker I used a similar hashing scheme to <b>partition open files</b> among worker threads to better drop contention.
                At the same time I added <b>skip lists</b> to time series host name lookups and utilized <b>memory mapped I/O</b> to greatly reduce system context switches and dirty page management.
                The end result, our production data storage nodes now run comfortably doing <b>1.2M inserts/updates per second</b> with negligible CPU usage.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphdat.com / Alphashack<span>CTO - July 2012-April 2014 - Seattle, WA</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Managed all aspects of the business (investors, staffing, etc..)</li>
                <li>Primary architect of the one second monitoring technology behind Graphdat.com</li>
                <li>Built a browser based graphing engine offering pan, zoom, and realtime views</li>
                <li>Created a distributed metric data store optimized for one second data</li>
                <li>Created a small footprint agent for collecting machine telemetry data</li>
                <li>Acquired by Boundary.com</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The idea behind Graphdat.com came about while working at C4 and experiencing extremely high gameday web traffic.
                We had some very expensive monitoring tools which could only refresh graphs every twenty seconds.  Our goal with Graphdat.com
                was to provide a <b>cloud based</b> service, to monitor <b>any metric</b>, at <b>one second resolution</b>, <b>easily</b> and <b>cheaply</b>.
                I designed and built the majority of the system which was composed of three main parts, a metric data collection <b>agent</b>,
                fast backend <b>data storage</b>, and an interactive <b>graphing browser UI</b>.  For the <b>lowest overhead memory and CPU</b> the data collection agent was written
                in C (open source libsigar for metric reading). Because we pre-aggregate data (similar to OLAP cube rollups) each point generated many other points so the data store
                needed to be very efficient.  Our testing suggested we could get the best performance if I wrote a <b>custom built data store</b> in C.
                Finally, for the UI, at the time we found client based vector graphics using SVG were sluggish so I instead built a <b>canvas based interactive graph</b>
                which used a <b>sparse time range</b> data cache to optimize server communication.  I worked closely with one other engineer to release Graphdat.com
                which was then <b>acquired</b> after approximately 2 years of development.

            <h2>PlayUp.com<span>CTO - September 2011-July 2012 - Melbourne, Australia</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical leadership for a group of 50 building a social network mobile app for sports enthusiasts</li>
                <li>Involved with team restructuring in order to streamline the business</li>
                <li>Worked closely with the CEO and stakeholders to provide technical insight</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                PlayUp was in need of a direction change when I joined.  Agile development practices in conjunction with a
                less technical CEO made it difficult to obtain a shared <b>understanding of release dates</b> and delays.  In addition
                there were many projects unrelated to the primary company direction that were distracting and consuming valuable resources.
                I worked with the CEO to hone in on the company vision and <b>articulated technical trade-offs</b> in terms that were <b>easy to understand</b>.
                After which we decided to <b>drop some of the projects</b> not related to this vision.  Staff were reduced.  At the same time I proposed a change to the existing agile methodology
                which provided <b>more realistic time estimates</b>.  Although there were many challenges we eventually shipped a complete rewrite of our
                mobile sports social network in about <b>one half the time</b> the previous version took with a <b>minimal slip</b> and <b>lower burn rate</b>.  Of our remaining employees after the
                initial restructure we had <b>minimal turnover</b>.

                <li>Acquired by FetchTV</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After the acquisition of C4 my CEO had made a connection with someone at Usaha Tegas, a Malaysian conglomerate, at a time when one of their
                media divisions needed some <b>new leadership</b>.  I was first relocated to Malaysia along with my CEO and another top ex-C4 employee.
                Once in Malaysia we attempted to <b>revamp the engineering team</b> and <b>cut unneeded expenses</b>.  I travelled to India to <b>personally interview</b>
                all our outsourcing candidates.  We did another 70 interviews for onshore developers with no candidate offers.  After nine months I recommended that the media division
                open a <b>new development office</b> based in Sydney, AU because of its proximity and the probability of finding better engineers.
                I moved to Sydney to start a new office.  We then grew the office to approximately 50 while <b>rebuilding and improving the CMS</b> used
                by the media division.  Our office was located next to the IPTV sister company called FetchTV which eventually <b>acquired</b> Digital Five.

                <li>Worked closely with internal stakeholders and external content rights owners</li>

                <li>Acquired by Photon Group Pty Ltd</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The greatest challenge of C4 was managing expectation for a large, non-technical, population of <b>stakeholders</b> while
                simultaneously assisting with the technical challenges related to websites which would change traffic profiles <b>dramatically
                during game days</b>.  For example, unique visitors during a weekday may be several thousand but on a weekend with
                matches we may see <b>4M unique visitors</b>.  This unique performance curve in conjunction with our general purpose CMS (DotNetNuke) which
                was serving some rather <b>complicated sport summary data</b> made for some difficult performance scenarios.  I had to problem solve at the database tier
                to find slow queries, remove xml transforms, stop intermediate sorts which turned <b>reads to writes</b>, and insure caching.  From there
                I proposed and built a centralized <b>shared caching</b> solution which would become an early predecessor to REDIS open source.  It was during this
                time that the beginning of the idea for Graphdat.com came about. C4 was <b>acquired</b> by Photon Group Pty Ltd.

            <p>
                When I joined the company needed to be able to <b>rapidly prototype</b> Windows mobile applications.  After looking
                at some existing toolkits I proposed a different solution taking advantage of open source which had recently become
                available.  I was the core developer for this <b>new development environment</b> which would take advantage of the Spider Monkey <b>JavaScript</b>
                embeddable library, the Scintilla <b>text editor</b>, a <b>SQLite</b> data store, and a custom <b>UI framework using markup</b> and a flow layout.  I built a
                a desktop environment which had rich text editing, auto-complete, an emulator and <b>remote device debugging</b> support.  I also built the mobile device runtime.
                This became a <b>new product</b> called Protara which was marketed outside of the service oriented business.
